# Release process

The release process follows the usual PR-and-review flow, allowing an external reviewer to have a final check before publishing.

In order to ease downstream packaging of Rust binaries, an archive of vendored dependencies is also provided (only relevant for offline builds).

## Requirements

This guide requires:

 * A web browser (and network connectivity)
 * `git`
 * [GPG setup][GPG setup] and personal key for signing
 * [git-evtag](https://github.com/cgwalters/git-evtag/)
 * `cargo` (suggested: latest stable toolchain from [rustup][rustup])
 * A verified account on crates.io
 * Write access to this GitHub project
 * Upload access to this project on GitHub, crates.io
 * Membership in the [Fedora CoreOS Crates Owners group](https://github.com/orgs/coreos/teams/fedora-coreos-crates-owners/members)

## Release checklist

- Prepare local branch+commit
  - [ ] `git checkout -b release`
  - [ ] Bump the version number in `Cargo.toml`.  Usually you just want to bump the patch.
  - [ ] Run `cargo build` to ensure `Cargo.lock` would be updated
  - [ ] Commit changes `git commit -a -m 'Release x.y.z'`; include some useful brief changelog.

- Prepare the release
  - [ ] Run `./ci/prepare-release.sh`

- Validate that `origin` points to the canonical upstream repository and not your fork:
  `git remote show origin` should not be `github.com/$yourusername/$project` but should
  be under the organization ownership.  The remote `yourname` should be for your fork.

- open and merge a PR for this release:
  - [ ] `git push --set-upstream origin release`
  - [ ] open a web browser and create a PR for the branch above
  - [ ] make sure the resulting PR contains the commit
  - [ ] in the PR body, write a short changelog with relevant changes since last release
  - [ ] get the PR reviewed, approved and merged

- publish the artifacts (tag and crate):
  - [ ] `git fetch origin && git checkout ${RELEASE_COMMIT}`
  - [ ] verify `Cargo.toml` has the expected version
  - [ ] `git-evtag sign v${RELEASE_VER}`
  - [ ] `git push --tags origin v${RELEASE_VER}`
  - [ ] `cargo publish`

- publish this release on GitHub:
  - [ ] find the new tag in the [GitHub tag list](https://github.com/coreos/bootupd/tags), click the triple dots menu, and create a release for it
  - [ ] write a short changelog (i.e. re-use the PR content)
  - [ ] upload `target/${PROJECT}-${RELEASE_VER}-vendor.tar.gz`
  - [ ] record digests of local artifacts:
    - `sha256sum target/package/${PROJECT}-${RELEASE_VER}.crate`
    - `sha256sum target/${PROJECT}-${RELEASE_VER}-vendor.tar.gz`
  - [ ] publish release

- clean up:
  - [ ] `git push origin :release`
  - [ ] `cargo clean`
  - [ ] `git checkout master`
